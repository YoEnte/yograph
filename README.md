some graphing tool for [Software Challenge Germany](https://software-challenge.de/) 2023 for testing graphs, which we did not really use

Code of our bot: [repo by rubykanima](https://github.com/RubyKanima/socha-client/tree/dev), with which we placed 5th in the tournament
Repo is a bit messy and I actually do not remember which part of the code in which branch was the final version, but there is a lot to find over there
